Or `F:\\Media`. And every time this path has to be updated in\r\nKodi's settings, and every time all media has to be re-added.\r\nNobody wants to have to do that the whole time, right? Which is where this program comes in.\r\n\r\nBefore your media folder would be located here:  \r\nComputer 1: `D:\\Media`  \r\nComputer 2: `E:\\Media`  \r\nComputer 3: `F:\\Media`  \r\n\r\nAfter this program does its work, it's still located in those folders, but also in `X:\\` (or whichever letter\r\nyou choose) on every computer.  \r\nSo, essentially, what this program does is mount your media folder as a virtual hard drive, and then launch\r\nKodi in portable mode, in which you can then (for example) specify `X:\\Music`, `X:\\TV-series` and `X:\\Films`\r\nas your media sources, without ever having to change that again.\r\n\r\nI'm planning to add more functionality in the future, such as the ability to keep the Kodi instllation up-to-date\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n- At least Windows Vista; Windows 7 or higher recommended\r\n- Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5.1 (installed by default on most modern Windows installations)\r\n- Kodi (or XBMC)\r\n\r\n## Installation and usage\r\nNothing to install, just a single `.exe` file.\r\nDownload from [/releases](https://github.com/nidunc/Portable-launcher-for-Kodi/releases).  \r\nOn first launch, the program will ask you for a few things, which it needs to be able to work.\r\nYou can change these settings after the first launch through the program's settings\r\n(the gear icon in the top-right - appears after you've finished the initial setup). The rest of the program should be pretty clear and not need any explanation, but if you need help feel free to [contact me](#contact-me).\r\n\r\nPlease do note that the program is currently in an experimental phase, which means that it might not be very stable, and you might encounter problems while using it.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n- [x] ALMOST DONE: Launch Kodi in portable mode (with `Kodi.exe -p`)\r\n- [x] ALMOST DONE: Mount user's media folder (using the C# equivalent of `subst.exe`)\r\n- [ ] TO-DO: move Kodi's installation folder to another place (an external hard drive, for example)\r\nif it's installed on the C:\\ drive (such as `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Kodi` or `C:\\Program Files\\Kodi`),  \r\nand uninstall Kodi from the computer afterwards (if it was installed to Program Files).\r\n- [ ] TO-DO: move Kodi's application data (from `AppData`) to the \"portable_data\" folder in Kodi's installation folder upon moving Kodi from `Program Files`, so existing users can immmediately continue their work.\r\n- [ ] TO-DO: use a different way of storing settings that is portable. There's nothing wrong with the current method I use (the built-in user settings), but a huge problem is is that with that method the settings are stored in the user's `AppData` folder, thus not portable/easily transferable. With the new method in place, the program can decide which method to use, depending on if the program is run from the system drive or an external hard drive (or USB-disk).\r\n- [ ] TO-DO: install/update Kodi (either manually initiated by the user, or automatically, if the user chooses to do that)\r\n\r\n**What would you like to see?
